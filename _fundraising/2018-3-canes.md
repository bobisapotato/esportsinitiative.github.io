ESI is back this Thursday (1/25) with another tournament!

We will be in the Maudine Cow Room, in the basement of the Ohio Union.

Doors will open at 7. Registration closes at 7:30 and we have the room until 11.

Entry is $5 ($3 pot, $2 venue). No venue fee with a full setup.

If you pre-register and show up to the tournament, Corey Zhu will give you a cookie upon registration.
 Pre-registration is free and there is no punishment for not showing up, so you might as well do it for a free cookie.
