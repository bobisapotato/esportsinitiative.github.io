		<p>Gerald 'Pustoi' Richland is a senior at The Ohio State University majoring in economics. In League of Legends, Pustoi is a high diamond AD Carry, and has been for the past 3 seasons. As one half of Ohio State University's bot lane, Pustoi is tasked with outputting as much damage as possible while staying out of harmâ€™s way. His knowledge of bot lane match ups allows Pustoi to excel in the laning phase while his safe positioning enables him to shred the enemy frontline during team fights. On some of his favorite champions like Lucian and Ezreal, Pustoi can clean up skirmishes and push his team to victory.</p>
